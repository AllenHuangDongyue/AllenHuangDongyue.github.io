I am a Ph.D. candidate of Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Ben M. Chen](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/~bmchen/) and [Dr. Patrick Xi Chen](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/chen-xi/). I am working at the [Unmanned System Reserach Group (USR)](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/~usr/) with the topic of development on the Aerial-Aquatic Vehicle. During my Ph.D., I was a research intern at [Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL)](https://www.pcl.ac.cn/) and [Tongji Unversity](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/). I received my M.Sc. in Mechanical and Automation Engineering from CUHK, Hong Kong, China, in 2020. During the master, I was supervised by Dr. Ben M. Chen as well. In 2019, I received my B.Sc. in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation from [Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT)](https://english.gdut.edu.cn/), China, and B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from [Queen's University Belfast (QUB)](https://www.qub.ac.uk/), UK, under the supervision of [Dr. Adrian Murphy](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/adrian-murphy). I have also spent some time at [VisionNav Robotics](https://www.visionnav.cn/) in Shenzhen, China.
